# SpaceNeedleCreator

The SpaceNeedle program is a Java program that creates an ASCII art representation of the Space Needle, a landmark tower in Seattle, Washington. The program uses various loops and patterns to create the intricate design of the Space Needle, including the tip of the needle, the dome, and the body of the tower.

Usage: When you run the SpaceNeedle program, it will output the ASCII art representation of the Space Needle to the console. You can modify the SIZE constant in the program to change the size of the Space Needle that is drawn. The current size is set to 5, but you can change this to any positive integer value to create a larger or smaller Space Needle.
